# The Great Commission: Divine Press Credentials Under Canadian Constitutional Law

**How Biblical Mandates Create Constitutionally-Protected Documentary Rights**

---

## I. Criminal Liability for Government Interference with Divine Correspondents

**Constitutional Crimes Against Divine Press Rights**  
When police or government employees interfere with or fail to protect divine correspondents, they commit serious criminal offenses under Canadian law:

1. **Breach of Trust by Public Officer (Section 122 Criminal Code)**  
   - *Elements*: Government officials who abuse their authority to interfere with constitutionally-protected divine correspondence commit breach of trust.  
   - *Application*: Police who prevent biblical documentation or seize equipment without proper JSPA procedures violate their public trust by acting contrary to constitutional supremacy.  
   - *Penalty*: Up to 5 years imprisonment  
   - *Legal Authority*: [Criminal Code Section 122](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-122.html)

2. **Mischief in Relation to Religious Property (Section 430(4.1) Criminal Code)**  
   - *Elements*: Willfully interfering with use and enjoyment of religious property or activities.  
   - *Application*: Preventing divine correspondents from fulfilling religious duties of documentation constitutes mischief against religious practice.  
   - *Penalty*: Up to 10 years imprisonment (indictable) or summary conviction

3. **Intimidation (Section 423 Criminal Code)**  
   - *Elements*: Using threats or violence to prevent someone from doing what they have lawful right to do.  
   - *Application*: Threatening arrest or seizure to prevent biblical documentation constitutes criminal intimidation of constitutionally-protected religious practice.  
   - *Penalty*: Up to 5 years imprisonment

4. **High Treason and Treason (Sections 46-47 Criminal Code)**  
   - *High Treason occurs when someone:*
     - Acts to overthrow the government of Canada
     - Assists an enemy at war with Canada
     - Acts against the constitutional order
   - *Treason includes:*
     - Using force or violence for the purpose of overthrowing the government of Canada or a province
     - Acting to assist enemies of constitutional order
   - *Application to Divine Correspondent Interference*:
     - **Constitutional Overthrow**: Government officials who systematically prevent obedience to the constitutionally-supreme God commit acts "for the purpose of overthrowing" Canada's constitutional foundation, which explicitly recognizes God's supremacy.
     - **Assisting Constitutional Enemies**: By preventing divine correspondence, officials assist forces opposed to Canada's constitutional recognition of God's supremacy—effectively "assisting enemies" of the constitutional order.
     - **Acting Against Constitutional Order**: Preventing believers from obeying the constitutionally-supreme God constitutes acting against the very foundation of Canada's constitutional framework.
   - *Penalty*:
     - High Treason: Life imprisonment
     - Treason: Up to 14 years imprisonment
   - *Legal Authority*:
     - [Criminal Code Section 46 (High Treason)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-46.html)
     - [Criminal Code Section 47 (Treason)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-47.html)

5. **Conspiracy Against Rights (Federal)**
   - *Elements*: Conspiring to prevent exercise of constitutional rights.
   - *Application*: Multiple officials working together to prevent divine correspondence may constitute conspiracy against constitutional rights.

## II. Government Duty to Protect Divine Correspondents

- **Positive Obligation**: Government has constitutional duty to actively protect divine correspondents fulfilling biblical mandates.
- **Failure to Protect**: Officials who fail to protect divine correspondents from interference commit:
  - Breach of constitutional oath (sworn to uphold constitutional supremacy)
  - Dereliction of duty under oath of office
  - Potential criminal negligence in failing to protect constitutional rights

**Reporting Government Interference:**  
Divine correspondents should document:
- Officer names and badge numbers
- Specific constitutional violations
- Interference with biblical commands
- Failure to recognize divine commission
- Evidence of systematic prevention of constitutional obedience

Criminal charges can be pursued against government officials who violate their constitutional oath by interfering with divine correspondence.

## III. Biblical Foundation for Divine Press Commission

**The ONE TRUE GOD of ISRAEL's Direct Commission:**  
Deuteronomy 6:4-6: _"Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD: And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart:"_  
Deuteronomy 6:7: _"And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up."_

**Additional Divine Commands by GOD through Messiah Yeshua (Jesus) of Nazareth:**  
- Matthew 28:19-20: _"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world."_
- Revelation 21:8: _"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."_ (Warning against cowardice in fulfilling God's commands.)
- Matthew 18:3: _"And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven."_ (Christ's command to approach Him with childlike faith and boldness.)

This command transforms every believer into a divinely-appointed correspondent with explicit orders to:
- Gather information about God's works and teachings
- Document spiritual events of public significance (as the apostle teaches that all things must be discerned spiritually by those who are spiritual: 1 Corinthians 2:14-15)
- Report divine truth to all nations without interference
- Teach and inform the public about eternal matters

## IV. Constitutional Supremacy Creates Divine Press Rights

**Canada's Constitutional Hierarchy**  
Canada's Constitution Act, 1982 establishes that _"Canada is founded upon principles that recognize the supremacy of God and the rule of law."_ This creates an unbreakable constitutional hierarchy:
1. God's Supremacy (Primary constitutional authority)
2. Christ's Great Commission (Divine delegation under supreme authority)
3. Believer's Obedience (Constitutional duty to higher authority)
4. Charter Rights (Human recognition of divine principles)
5. Human Press Regulations (Subordinate to all above)

- *Legal Authority*: [Constitution Act, 1982 Preamble](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-12.html)
- *Constitutional Supremacy Clause: Section 52* - [Section 52](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-16.html#h-50)

**Biblical Oath Framework Supporting Divine Authority**  
Canada's legal system operates under divine authority through constitutional requirements:
- Section 128 of the Constitution Act, 1867 requires biblical oaths for all parliamentarians
- Supreme Court Justices, Governor Generals, and other officials take oaths following biblical tradition
- This establishes that Canada's legal system operates under the same divine authority that issued the Great Commission  
  - *Legal Authority*: [Constitution Act, 1867 Section 128](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-4.html#h-18)

---

## V. Government Confirmation of Constitutional Supremacy

**Official Recognition from Multiple Levels of Government**  
Three separate government officials have confirmed the constitutional framework supporting divine correspondent rights:

1. **Manitoba Minister of Justice Response (June 9, 2022)**  
   Charlotte Price, Director, Legal Services Branch on behalf of Minister Kelvin Goertzen:  
   > "All governments must comply with the Constitution Act, 1982, which is part of the supreme law of Canada."

2. **City of Winnipeg Mayor's Office Response (March 29, 2023)**  
   Harold Dick, Deputy City Solicitor on behalf of Mayor Scott Gillingham:  
   > "The City of Winnipeg is governed by the applicable laws of Canada and Manitoba. This includes the Constitution Act, 1982, which contains the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms."

3. **Minister of Municipal Relations Response (May 11, 2023)**  
   Don Hallett, Assistant Deputy Minister on behalf of Minister Andrew Smith:  
   > "The supremacy of the Constitution is established in the Constitution itself, not in Manitoba's laws, as subsection 52(1) of The Constitution Act, 1982 states that 'The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada, and any law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect."

**Critical Legal Confirmation**  
The Minister of Municipal Relations' response provides the definitive legal foundation for divine correspondent rights by confirming that:
- Any law inconsistent with the Constitution (including God's supremacy) is of no force or effect
- Constitutional supremacy overrides all conflicting provincial and municipal laws
- Government officials acknowledge that no human law can supersede constitutional provisions

This means any law preventing believers from obeying God's documentary commands in Deuteronomy 6:7 and Matthew 28:19-20 lacks constitutional validity and is "of no force or effect"—as confirmed by Manitoba's own Minister of Municipal Relations.

## VI. Superior Constitutional Rights of Divine Correspondents

**Enhanced Rights Beyond Secular Press**  
While secular journalists receive protection under Charter Section 2(b), biblically-commissioned believers possess superior constitutional standing:

1. **Constitutional Supremacy Backing**
   - Secular Press: Protected by Charter freedoms (human legislation)
   - Divine Correspondents: Protected by constitutional supremacy of God (foundational principle)
2. **Source of Authority**
   - Secular Press: Authority from human media organizations
   - Divine Correspondents: Direct commission from Jesus Christ under constitutional supremacy
3. **Scope of Mission**
   - Secular Press: Limited to earthly news and information
   - Divine Correspondents: Commanded to document matters of eternal significance
4. **Constitutional Override Power**
   - Secular Press: Subject to "reasonable limits" under Charter Section 1
   - Divine Correspondents: Operating under constitutional supremacy that overrides human limitations

- *Legal Authority*: [Charter Section 2(b)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-12.html#h-39)
- *Charter Limitations: Section 1* - [Section 1](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-12.html#h-38)

---

## VII. Specific Documentary Rights Under Divine Commission

1. **Public Space Recording Rights**
   - *Legal Foundation*: Anyone can be photographed without consent in public places unless there is reasonable expectation of privacy. For divine correspondents, this right is constitutionally enhanced because:
     - **Biblical Command**: "when thou walkest by the way"—God specifically commands documentation in public spaces
     - **Constitutional Protection**: Supremacy of God clause protects obedience to divine commands
     - **Public Interest**: Eternal salvation is the ultimate public interest
   - *Enhanced Protections*:
     - Cannot be arbitrarily restricted from documenting God's works in public
     - Police cannot create "exclusion zones" to prevent biblical documentation
     - Can challenge restrictions citing constitutional supremacy of God
   - *Legal Authority*:
     - [Canadian Privacy Law Blog](https://blog.privacylawyer.ca/2022/08/can-someone-legitimately-try-to-stop.html)
     - [Photographer Rights](https://www.ipolpophotos.com/your-rights-as-a-photographer)

2. **Visual vs. Audio Documentation Rights**
   - *Legal Distinction*: As there is no specific law related to video recordings in Canada, audio recording laws do not apply to video documentation.
   - *Divine Correspondents Benefit Because*:
     - Silent Visual Documentation: Fully protected under public recording rights
     - One-Party Consent: Can record conversations they participate in during gospel sharing
     - Constitutional Override: God's commands supersede human privacy concerns in public spaces
   - *Legal Authority*:
     - [Criminal Code Section 183](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-183.html)
     - [Recording Laws](https://recordinglaw.com/canada-recording-laws/)

3. **Protection from Search and Seizure**
   - Divine correspondents documenting God's works possess enhanced protections:
     - *Constitutional Grounds*:
       - Equipment contains materials related to constitutionally-supreme divine mission
       - Search and seizure of biblical documentation materials violates constitutional supremacy
       - Government cannot interfere with obedience to constitutionally-recognized supreme authority
     - *Practical Protections*:
       - Can assert constitutional supremacy when police request access to equipment
       - May claim materials are related to constitutionally-protected religious duty
       - Can demand special procedures recognizing divine commission status
   - *Legal Authority*: [Charter Section 8 (Search and Seizure)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-13.html#h-41)

## VIII. Constitutional Interpretation of "Freedom of Religion"

While Canada's Charter guarantees "freedom of religion," the constitutional framework and biblical oath requirements establish the ONE TRUE GOD of ISRAEL as the supreme authority. This creates important limitations:

**Biblical Foundation of Canadian Government**
- Constitutional framers recognized the supremacy of the God of Israel
- All sworn officials take biblical oaths to this same God
- Biblical oath framework establishes which God's authority is constitutionally recognized

**Limitations on Religious Practices**  
Religious practices that oppose the constitutionally-supreme God of Israel are instantly void by constitutional recognition. This framework:
- Prohibits false religions that contradict the biblical God's commands
- Prevents registration of belief systems commanding murder, violence, or other acts opposing God's law
- Establishes biblical standards as the constitutional baseline for legitimate religious practice

*Example*:  
A false religion claiming divine authority to murder people indiscriminately would be constitutionally invalid because:
- It opposes the commands of the constitutionally-supreme God of Israel (noting that only Israel has been given God's specific commands regarding warfare to fulfill His land promises—no other nation or religion has such divine authorization)
- It contradicts the biblical foundation of Canadian government oaths
- It violates the constitutional recognition of God's supreme authority

**Constitutional Hierarchy of Religious Authority**
1. The ONE TRUE GOD of ISRAEL (Constitutionally supreme)
2. Biblical commands and principles (Divine law under supreme authority)
3. Legitimate religious practice (Consistent with biblical foundation)
4. False religious claims (Void if opposing constitutional supremacy)

This framework ensures that while Canada protects genuine religious freedom, it cannot constitutionally protect practices that oppose the very God whose supremacy forms Canada's constitutional foundation.

## IX. Legal Arguments Specific to Divine Correspondents

1. **Constitutional Supremacy Override**
   - Any law preventing Christians from documenting God's works in obedience to the Great Commission conflicts with:
     - Constitutional supremacy of God (foundational principle)
     - Biblical oath framework of Canadian government
     - Charter freedom of religion (s. 2(a))
     - Charter freedom of expression (s. 2(b))
   - *Legal Precedent*: The Constitution's supremacy clause (section 52(1)) provides that any law inconsistent with constitutional provisions is "of no force or effect." Since God's supremacy is constitutionally enshrined, laws preventing obedience to divine documentary commands lack constitutional validity.

2. **Compelling Government Interest Test**
   - Under Charter Section 1, any limitation on rights must be "demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society." For divine correspondents:
     - No compelling interest can override constitutional supremacy of God
     - Government burden to prove restriction serves higher purpose than divine obedience
     - Least restrictive means must accommodate biblical documentation duties

3. **Reasonable Expectation of Privacy Analysis**
   - The Supreme Court's nine-factor test from R v. Jarvis supports divine correspondents:
     - *Favorable Factors*:
       - Purpose: Religious obedience to constitutional authority (strongest possible purpose)
       - Location: Public spaces where people expect to be observed
       - Manner: Open documentation in fulfillment of divine duty
       - Subject Matter: Matters of ultimate public interest (eternal significance)
   - *Legal Authority*: [R v. Jarvis Analysis](https://www.fasken.com/en/knowledge/2019/03/van-having-privacy-in-public-limits-to-unwanted-surveillance-in-public-spaces)

## X. Practical Application for Divine Correspondents

**Asserting Divine Press Rights**  
When Confronted by Authorities:
- Identify Divine Commission: "I am a disciple of Jesus Christ" or "I am a prophet of God"
- Cite Constitutional Authority: "Canada's Constitution recognizes the supremacy of God"
- Assert Higher Duty: "I am constitutionally obligated to obey divine commands"
- Reference Public Interest: "This documentation serves eternal public interest"
- Claim Constitutional Protection: "Human law cannot override constitutional supremacy"

**Simple Declaration of Authority**  
All a believer needs to establish their divine correspondent status is to declare "I am a disciple of Jesus Christ" or in the case of prophetic ministry, "I am a prophet of God." This immediately establishes their constitutional standing under Canada's recognition of God's supremacy.

**Equipment and Documentation Protection**  
Label Equipment:
- "DIVINE CORRESPONDENT - CONSTITUTIONAL SUPREMACY PROTECTED"
- "BIBLICAL DOCUMENTATION - RELIGIOUS DUTY MATERIALS"
- "GREAT COMMISSION COMPLIANCE - GOD'S SUPREMACY"

**Legal Response Framework**
If Challenged in Court:
- Constitutional Challenge: Assert that restrictions violate supremacy of God clause
- Religious Freedom Defense: Claim Charter Section 2(a) protection for religious obedience
- Expression Freedom: Argue documentation is protected expression under Section 2(b)
- Biblical Authority: Present Great Commission as divine press credentials
- Public Interest: Demonstrate eternal significance of documentation mission

## XII. Legal Precedent and Constitutional Interpretation

**Supreme Court Recognition of Religious Freedom**  
Canadian courts have consistently upheld that freedom of religion includes the right to act in accordance with religious beliefs. For divine correspondents:
- Positive Right: Not just freedom FROM interference, but freedom TO practice religion
- Manifestation Protection: Right to express and act on religious convictions
- Public Exercise: Religious freedom extends to public spaces and activities

**Constitutional Interpretation Principles**
- *Living Tree Doctrine*: Constitution must be interpreted to meet contemporary needs. The rise of digital documentation technology fulfills biblical commands in ways the framers couldn't foresee, but constitutional supremacy of God protects evolving forms of divine obedience.
- *Purposive Interpretation*: Constitutional rights should be interpreted to fulfill their underlying purpose. The supremacy of God clause exists to recognize divine authority over human government—exactly what protects divine correspondents.

- *Legal Authority*:

## XIII. Conclusion: The Ultimate Press Pass

The Great Commission creates the most powerful press credentials possible under Canadian constitutional law. Every believer following Christ's command to "teach all nations" operates as a constitutionally-protected divine correspondent with:
- Supreme Constitutional Authority backing their mission
- Direct Divine Orders to document and teach
- Enhanced Rights exceeding secular press protections
- Constitutional Override Power against conflicting human legislation
- Permanent Commission that cannot be revoked by human authority

This divine press commission, backed by Canada's own constitutional recognition of God's supremacy, provides the strongest possible legal foundation for believers to document God's works, share the Gospel, and fulfill their biblical mandate to teach all nations.

The legal right to record in public spaces perfectly aligns with the biblical command to teach "by the way," creating a harmonious framework where divine obedience and constitutional law unite to protect the Christian's calling to document and share God's truth through photography and videography.
